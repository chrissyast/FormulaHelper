Hello and thanks for trying out my formula helper!

### How to run

Simply download the JAR file and enter a ternary formula (e.g. ```condition && anotherCondition ? trueResult : falseResult```)

The program will offer some basic linting on the formula - checking that open and closing parentheses are even and in a logical order, and the same for question marks and colons.

If the formula passes validation, it will then be broken down into a series of true/false questions designed to guide you to the eventual output of your formula for the given conditions.
